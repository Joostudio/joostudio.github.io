            <p><strong>Accessible Login</strong></p><br>

                </div>
            </section>
            <p><br><strong>Problem: </strong>First-time users of the iOrderFoods online ordering platform often faced difficulties logging in, with many expressing confusion about the login process. This issue was particularly prominent among new customers who were unsure how to proceed.
            <br><strong>Design Solution:</strong>To address this, the login process was optimized by ensuring the login screen appears immediately when users press the order button, making the process more intuitive and seamless, and enhancing overall accessibility for users.

                <img src="portfolio/img/pux_3.png" alt="Enhanced Payment Flow"  height="500">
            </div>
        </section>
        <p><br><strong>Problem: </strong>Customers often mistakenly believed they had completed their online order without finalizing the payment, leading to missed transactions when they arrived for pickup.
        <br><strong>Design Solution:</strong>We made the payment button remain visible until the payment is successfully completed, reducing confusion and improving the overall checkout experience.

        <p><strong>Visual Menu Improvements</strong></p><br>

            <div class="folio-images">
                <img src="portfolio/img/pux_4.png" alt="Visual Menu Improvements"  height="500">
            </div>
        </section>
        <p><br><strong>Problem: </strong>In the iOrderFoods Ecommerce Platform, menu information was only provided as text, making it difficult for customers to easily identify features such as spicy or veggie. Additionally, recommended items and other important information could not be effectively highlighted.
        <br><strong>Design Solution:</strong>I added visible spicy and veggie icons to the menu and created color blocks to highlight recommended items and other important information, improving visual communication and making key features more accessible.
        </p><br>

            </div>
        </section>
        <p><strong>Problem: </strong>Both existing and new users of the iOrderFoods platform frequently encountered difficulties and had numerous questions, resulting in an overwhelming number of customer support calls.
        <br><strong>Design Solution:</strong>To enhance customer service, I launched a comprehensive support portal providing training materials for new users and quick solutions for existing users, reducing customer support calls by approximately 90%.

            </div>
        </section>
        <p><br><strong>Problem: </strong>Both existing and new users often faced difficulties while using the iOrderFoods online ordering platform, and even though a user guide was launched, it was anticipated that users would have difficulty accessing it because they would need to remember the URL.
        <br><strong>Design Solution:</strong>To address this issue, a User Guide site was launched, and a direct link was added to the iOrderFoods Ecommerce Admin Dashboard, improving accessibility for users.

       <h3>2. Order Management System</h3>

        <p><strong>Enhanced Order Management</strong></p><br>
        <section class="folio">
            <div class="folio-images">
                <img src="portfolio/img/pux_7.png" alt="Enhanced Order Management"  height="500">
            </div>
        </section>
        <br><p><strong>Problem: </strong>Previously, the order notification app lacked features to adjust online ordering settings or modify pickup and delivery times, which were only accessible via the administrator mode of the platform.
        <br><strong>Design Solution:</strong>I added a toggle to enable/disable online ordering and implemented a slider to adjust pickup and delivery times, allowing for easier and more flexible order management.
        </p><br>

        </div>
    </section>
    <p><strong>Problem: </strong>New and confirmed orders were not clearly distinguished, making it difficult for staff to track whether an order had been reviewed. This led to missed orders and caused confusion in order management.
    <br><strong>Design Solution:</strong>I highlighted unconfirmed orders with bold text and a red dot indicator to make unread orders clearly visible. Additionally, I implemented a persistent notification bar that continuously alerts users about unread orders, ensuring no orders are missed, even when the order screen is not in view.

        </div>
    </section>
    <p><strong>Problem: </strong>Users of the iOrderFoods order notification app often confused it with the iOrderFoods Ecommerce Platform admin settings, which led to difficulty in accessing and managing settings.
    <br><strong>Design Solution:</strong>I added a direct link to the admin page via the hamburger menu, which opens a new panel displaying various options for easier access and management of settings.
