# Yunsun Joo – Portfolio

Hi! I'm a Product Designer & Illustrator passionate about clarity, emotion, and creating user experiences that *feel* good as much as they *work* well.

🎯 **What’s in here?**  
This is the codebase for my portfolio site – [joostudio.github.io](https://joostudio.github.io) – designed and developed from scratch to reflect my design values: clear communication, focused layout, and a touch of personality.

- Vanilla JavaScript  
- Responsive, mobile-first design  
- Custom layout and typography

📌 **Features**  
- Modular grid with consistent visual hierarchy  
- Responsive hamburger nav  
- Smooth interactions & CTA clarity  
- Custom project pages with UX storytelling  
- Integrated with Google Analytics

📝 *I built this within what I currently know.*  
*I just found out that I could use frameworks or templates — but I haven’t tried them yet.*  
*This portfolio was built from scratch as a bold experiment (thanks to GitHub being free).*  
*I truly appreciate all the unexpected attention.*

*I'll continue to update this site as needed — especially for the StyleWise: Pick project, which is evolving toward a functional prototype.  
Thanks again for your interest!*

⚠️ Built without frameworks or templates —  
just sheer curiosity, lots of Googling, and a bit of chaos.  
Maybe people are amazed by my recklessness and lack of technical awareness. Who knows? 😂

⚠️ Editing the site manually was... intense.

🤷‍♀️ I honestly thought this is how websites are made.  
Turns out I accidentally built something people find refreshing…  
using just HTML, CSS, and a little bit of pure chaos.

🧩 **Update – April 13, 2025**  
This site is currently being developed into two templates:  
**Resonant Lite** – minimal, fast, and clean  
**Resonant Pro** – expressive, modular, and fully extensible

Both will be available via Gumroad with complete guides and source files.  
If you're here thinking of cloning... maybe hold off just a little? 😉  
The official versions will be clearer, lighter, and much more fun to customize.

Thank you for your quiet visits, unexpected curiosity, and occasional chaos. 👀  
I'm watching too — with a smile.

**_Last public preview before official release._**

👀 From April 1 to April 13 (9:14pm PT), this site has reached **351 views** from GitHub alone.  
I didn’t expect this much quiet curiosity — but thank you for watching, whoever you are.  
Built without frameworks, fueled by Google searches… and now apparently bookmarked by more than a few.

🎯 **The Miracle of Ignorance™**
