# Yunsun Joo – Portfolio

Hi! I'm a Product Designer & Illustrator passionate about clarity, emotion, and creating user experiences that *feel* good as much as they *work* well.

🎯 **What’s in here?**

📝 *I built this within what I currently know.*  
*I just found out that I could use frameworks or templates — but I haven’t tried them yet.*  
*This portfolio was built from scratch as a bold experiment (thanks to GitHub being free).*  
*I truly appreciate all the unexpected attention.*

*I'll continue to update this site as needed — especially for the StyleWise: Pick project, which is evolving toward a functional prototype.  
Thanks again for your interest!*

⚠️ Built without frameworks or templates —  
just sheer curiosity, lots of Googling, and a bit of chaos.  
Maybe people are amazed by my recklessness and lack of technical awareness. Who knows? 😂

⚠️ Editing the site manually was... intense.

🤷‍♀️ I honestly thought this is how websites are made.  
Turns out I accidentally built something people find refreshing…  
using just HTML, CSS, and a little bit of pure chaos.
