# Yunsun Joo – Portfolio

Hi! I'm a Product Designer & Illustrator passionate about clarity, emotion, and creating user experiences that *feel* good as much as they *work* well.

🎯 **What’s in here?**  
This is the codebase for my portfolio site – https://yunsunjoo.com/ – designed and developed from scratch to reflect my design values: clear communication, focused layout, and a touch of personality.

🛠️ **Built with**  
- HTML5 / CSS3  
- Vanilla JavaScript  
- Responsive, mobile-first design  
- Custom layout and typography

📌 **Features**  
- Modular grid with consistent visual hierarchy  
- Responsive hamburger nav  
- Smooth interactions & CTA clarity  
- Custom project pages with UX storytelling  
- Integrated with Google Analytics

💬 **And lately...**  
This repo has unexpectedly drawn quite a bit of attention — with hundreds of clones and visits.  
Whether you're here to explore, learn, or be inspired: thank you. I genuinely appreciate your interest.

📝 *I built this within what I currently know.*  
*I just found out that I could use frameworks or templates — but I haven’t tried them yet.*  
*This portfolio was built from scratch as a bold experiment (thanks to GitHub being free).*  
*I truly appreciate all the unexpected attention.*

*I'll continue to update this site as needed*

⚠️ Built without frameworks or templates —  
just sheer curiosity, lots of Googling, and a bit of chaos.  
Maybe people are amazed by my recklessness and lack of technical awareness. Who knows? 😂

⚠️ Editing the site manually was... intense.

🤷‍♀️ I genuinely thought this was just how websites were made.  
Turns out, this accidental method — pure HTML, CSS, and a little chaos — felt refreshingly different to many.  
I'm as surprised as you are.

🧩 **Update – April 15, 2025**  
**Joo Studio Resonate Lite** has officially launched on Gumroad:  
🔗 https://yunsun.gumroad.com/l/muwqbv

More extended template products are in the works —  
each will come with complete source files and user-friendly setup guides.

> The official versions will be clearer, lighter, and much more fun to customize.

Thank you for your quiet visits, unexpected curiosity, and occasional chaos. 👀  
I'm watching too — with a smile.

👀 From April 1 to April 14, this site has reached **284 clones** and **1.4k GitHub events**.  
I didn’t expect this much quiet curiosity — but thank you for watching, whoever you are.  
Built without frameworks, fueled by Google searches… and now apparently bookmarked by more than a few.

🎯 **The Miracle of Ignorance™**
